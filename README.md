# Numerical-modelling-of-Preheater-
A preheater is a heat exchanger where a heating coil is wrapped around a pipe, transferring heat to the fluid inside. The pipeâ€“coil assembly is insulated to reduce losses. The system was numerically modeled considering conduction and convection losses to predict outlet temperature and efficiency
